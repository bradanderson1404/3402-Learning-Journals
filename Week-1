## Estimated hours
- About an hour taking notes on the week 1 lecture (20 mins listening to the subject intro and ~30 for the review Qs)
- 2 hours at the weekly practical, listening and starting a Github repo for the weekly journals 
- ~4 hours completing all the self assigned resources to re-establish a good level of HTML coding knowledge before starting any assignments


## Content Insights


## Career / Employability Insights
- once I get started with using html, css and java again, I should really make a conscious effort to maintain these skills through constant practice
so that I don't have to re-learn any of the basics again, and can instead focus on learning more advanced styles and techniques to make myself more
employable when the time comes. 
- using the terminal is actually quite simple and I will definitely spend some of my time using vim and practicing more commands that I might have to
use in a job


## To-Do before next week
- Finish all the content in the resources list above
- Complete the practical website and publication task before 7th
